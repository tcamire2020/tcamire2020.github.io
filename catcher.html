		Abbreviation: C   |   Position #: 2

		There's a reason why the abbreviation for catcher also has to be the first letter of the word "Captain". It's because the catcher is the team's leader. He is the one who conducts the defense - telling them which plays they will run or what to do for the next hitter. Not only that, but he tells the pitcher which pitch to throw next. The Catcher will always have the loudest voice and be the angriest if you mess up in the infield. He uses a catcher's mit, which is much more padded than a regular baseball glove, for repeatedly catching the 90mph pitches the pitcher is hurling at him. Also, for the same reason, he wears a ton of protective gear, including a face mask, chest protector, knee and shin guards, and ALWAYS a cup. Below is a retired Red Sox catcher, Jason Varitek. It's very fitting that his nickname is "captain".
