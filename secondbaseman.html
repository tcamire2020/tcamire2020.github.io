		What a second baseman lacks in height, he makes up for in quickness and agility. Yes, a typical second baseman tends to be the shortest infielder, but he is always one of the more skilled. He needs to be quick because he has a lot of ground to cover on the right side of the diamond. He generally has the weakest arm since he has the shortest throw to first, but also will have the quickest catch and release for turning double plays with the shortstop. In the picture below, Dustin Pedroia (2B for the Red Sox) makes a diving stop to save a base hit.
