		The main job of the first baseman is to catch the other infielder's throws with his foot on first base before the runner reaches to record an out. However, ground balls are sometimes hit down the firt base line, so the first baseman can just field it, and tag the base to record the out. Some characteristics of a first baseman are that he is usually the tallest and biggest infielder, and the best power hitter. He uses a different type of glove called a first baseman's mit, which is a hybrid between a catcher's mit and an infielder's glove. This glove has extra padding to protect his hand from the lazers that the other infielders are throwing him. Pictured is Hanley Ramirez, the current first baseman for the Boston Red Sox.
