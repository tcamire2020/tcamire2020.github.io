			A pitcher's goal is to get the batter out. Whether that be by throwing some filthy, unhittable pitches and striking the batter out, or by throwing it in a way that makes the hitter either pop up or ground out. A pitcher will usually have multiple types of pitches he can choose to throw at any moment, each with a strategical value. A big part of pitching is the mind game between him and the batter. Basbeball is 50% mental, you know. Pitchers are usually very tall and lanky, due to the fact that they need as much leverage as possible to throw the ball over 90 miles an hour. A typical baseball team will have 5 starting pitchers, so a single pitcher will only pitch once every 5 games. In addition to starting pitchers, there are relief pitchers, that come in when the starter is tired or not doing well, and closer that come in to pitch in the 9th inning to try and maintain th team's small lead. Closers often have the strongest arms, most being able to reach over 100 miles an hour on thier fastball. Below is the Red Sox southpaw ace, Chris Sale. (southpaw = lefty  |  ace = best starting pitcher on the team)
