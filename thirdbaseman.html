			The third base line is where balls are generally hit the hardest (hence the nickname "hot corner"), so a third baseman needs to have cat-like reflexes, along with a good glove. A third baseman will generally be one of the taller infielders, along with having a very strong throwing arm and being a decent power hitter. The combination of a wild diving stop to a 130 foot lazer of a throw over to first makes for some of the best highlight clips in baseball. Below is an example of that by Nolan Arenado, 3B for the Colorado Rockies.
