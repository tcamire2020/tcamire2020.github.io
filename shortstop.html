			On the majority of teams, the shortstop is the all-star. He is arguably the most skilled fielder and one of the better hitters. Like the second baseman, he needs to be quick to cover a lot of  ground, and have a fast catch and release to turn double plays. He will most likely have to have a good throwing arm since he has a long way to throw to reach first base. A signature move by the shortstop is the fade away jump throw, arguably the quickest way to throw it over to first when you're momentum from fielding the ball to your right is bringing you towards third base. Xander Bogearts, the shortstop for the Red Sox, is in the middle of one of these jump throws.
